# Strike Team

A coordinated multi-agent execution mode that takes a spec or feature design document, breaks it into tasks with dependencies, then dispatches agents in parallel waves — maximizing throughput while respecting task ordering.

Named after the ICS (Incident Command System) term for a group of same-type units assembled for a specific mission.

## Overview

1. User provides a spec file (e.g., `docs/auth-spec.md`)
2. A **planner agent** reads the spec and creates a task file with dependencies
3. The console dispatches agents for all **ready** tasks (no unmet dependencies)
4. When an agent finishes, it merges to main and is terminated to free the slot
5. The console checks for newly unblocked tasks and dispatches the next wave
6. Repeats until all tasks are complete

## Task File Format

Location: `.dispatch/tasks-<name>.md`

```markdown
# Strike Team: auth-system
spec: docs/auth-spec.md

## T1: Implement user model
status: pending
dependencies: none
prompt: Create a User struct in src/models/user.rs with fields id, email, name, created_at. Add serde derives.

## T2: Add user API endpoints
status: pending
dependencies: T1
prompt: Create REST endpoints for CRUD operations on users in src/routes/users.rs.

## T3: Add authentication middleware
status: pending
dependencies: T1
prompt: Implement JWT authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.rs.

## T4: Wire auth into endpoints
status: pending
dependencies: T2, T3
prompt: Apply auth middleware to user endpoints. Add integration tests.
```

**Fields per task:**

| Field | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `status` | `pending`, `active`, `done`, `failed` | Current state |
| `dependencies` | `none` or comma-separated IDs (`T1, T3`) | Dependency list |
| `prompt` | Single line of text | Self-contained agent instruction |
| `agent` | Callsign (e.g., `Alpha`) | Written by console when assigned |

**Readiness rule:** a task is ready when its status is `pending` and all dependencies have status `done`.

**Parsing:** line-by-line string matching. `## T<N>:` starts a task, `key: value` lines set fields. No markdown parsing library needed.

## Lifecycle

```
Idle --> Planning --> Executing --> Complete
                 \-> Failed (planner error)
```

### Planning Phase

1. Orchestrator issues `strike_team(spec_file, name, repo)` tool call
2. Console dispatches a planner agent to the repo root (no worktree)
3. Planner reads the spec, creates `.dispatch/tasks-<name>.md`, reports task count via status message, then stops
4. Console detects planner idle/exit, parses the task file, transitions to Executing

### Execution Loop

Runs inside the existing 16ms main loop tick — no new threads or async.

1. `git pull --ff-only` in repo root (pick up prior merges from completed agents)
2. Scan tasks: find all where status=`pending` and all deps are `done`
3. For each ready task with an available slot: dispatch a fresh agent with the task's prompt
4. Update task file: status=`active`, agent=`<callsign>`
5. When an agent goes idle (existing 10s idle detection):
   - Mark task `done` in the task file
   - Terminate the agent (free the slot for next wave)
   - Re-run from step 1
6. When an agent process exits unexpectedly: mark task `failed`, continue
7. When all tasks are `done` or `failed`: transition to Complete

### Agent Lifecycle

Each task agent follows the normal dispatch workflow:
- Creates worktree from latest main (which includes all prior completed tasks)
- Works on its assigned task
- Merges to main, pushes, cleans up worktree
- Goes idle at the prompt

On idle detection, the console **terminates** the agent to free the slot. This ensures each subsequent agent starts fresh from the latest main with all prior merges.

## Orchestrator Tool

```json
{
  "name": "strike_team",
  "description": "Launch a Strike Team: break a spec into tasks with dependencies, then dispatch agents in parallel waves until all tasks are complete.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "spec_file": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Path to the spec/feature markdown file, relative to repo root."
      },
      "name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Short name for this operation. Defaults to spec filename without extension."
      },
      "repo": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Repository name or path."
      }
    },
    "required": ["spec_file", "repo"]
  }
}
```

## Planner Agent Prompt

The planner is dispatched with a special prompt (overrides normal AGENTS.md worktree instructions):

```
You are a task planner for the Dispatch Strike Team system. Your ONLY job is to
read a spec file and create a task breakdown.

1. Read the spec file at: {spec_file}
2. Create a task file at: .dispatch/tasks-{name}.md

Use this EXACT format:

# Strike Team: {name}
spec: {spec_file}

## T1: <short title>
status: pending
dependencies: none
prompt: <detailed prompt for an AI agent — include file paths, function names, acceptance criteria>

## T2: <short title>
status: pending
dependencies: T1
prompt: <detailed prompt>

RULES:
- Each task must be completable by a single agent in one session.
- Maximize parallelism: only add dependencies when truly required.
- Prompts must be self-contained with specific file paths and criteria.
- Sequential IDs: T1, T2, T3, etc.
- Aim for 3-15 tasks.
- Do NOT create a git worktree. Work directly in the repo root.
- After creating the file, report the task count via your status message file, then stop.
```

## UI

Minimal additions:

- **Header bar**: `STRIKE TEAM 3/7` (done/total) appended when active
- **Pane info strip**: task ID next to callsign, e.g., `Alpha [T3]`
- **Ticker messages** at lifecycle events:
  - `STRIKE TEAM: planning <name>...`
  - `STRIKE TEAM: plan ready, 7 tasks`
  - `STRIKE TEAM: T3 -> Alpha`
  - `STRIKE TEAM: T3 done (Alpha)`
  - `STRIKE TEAM: complete (7/7)`

## Architecture

### New module: `console/core/src/strike_team.rs`

Pure logic — no PTY, TUI, or async dependencies. Contains:

- `TaskStatus` enum (`Pending`, `Active`, `Done`, `Failed`)
- `Task` struct (id, title, status, dependencies, prompt, agent)
- `StrikeTeamPhase` enum (`Planning`, `Executing`, `Complete`, `Aborted`)
- `StrikeTeamState` struct (name, spec_file, repo, phase, tasks, task_file_path)
- Parser: `parse_task_file(contents) -> Vec<Task>`
- Writer: `write_task_file(&self) -> String`
- Readiness: `ready_tasks(&self) -> Vec<&Task>`
- Mutations: `assign_task()`, `complete_task()`, `task_for_agent()`, `is_complete()`, `summary()`

### Changes to existing files

**`console/core/src/lib.rs`** — `pub mod strike_team;`

**`console/core/src/tools.rs`** — Add `StrikeTeam` variant to `ToolCall` and `ToolResult` enums, tool definition JSON, parser arm.

**`console/src/types.rs`** — Add `strike_team: Option<StrikeTeamState>` to `App`.

**`console/src/app.rs`** — New methods:
- `execute_tool` arm for `StrikeTeam` (dispatch planner, init state)
- `tick_strike_team()` (advance state machine each frame)
- `strike_team_dispatch_ready()` (git pull, find ready tasks, dispatch agents)
- `strike_team_on_agent_idle(callsign)` (mark done, terminate, dispatch next wave)
- `strike_team_on_agent_exit(slot_idx)` (mark failed)

**`console/src/main.rs`** — Three hook points in the main loop:
1. After idle detection (~line 361): call `app.tick_strike_team()`
2. In AGENT_IDLE block (~line 324): call `app.strike_team_on_agent_idle(&callsign)`
3. In child_exited block (~line 279): call `app.strike_team_on_agent_exit(i)`

**`console/src/ui.rs`** — Header progress indicator, pane task ID label.

**`docs/ORCHESTRATOR.md`** — Add `strike_team` to action table.

**`docs/SPEC.md`** — Add Strike Team section.

## Edge Cases

- **Max slots full**: ready tasks wait. As agents finish and slots free up, next wave dispatches.
- **Agent failure**: task marked `failed`. Its dependents stay `pending` forever (blocked). Siblings continue normally.
- **Merge conflicts**: agents already handle conflicts per AGENTS.md. If unresolvable, agent reports failure.
- **Cancellation**: no special mechanism. User terminates agents manually. Console stops dispatching if strike team state is cleared.
- **One at a time**: only one strike team active at once. Second `strike_team` call returns an error.

## Implementation Sequence

1. Core types + parser in `strike_team.rs` with unit tests
2. Tool definition in `tools.rs`
3. App integration in `app.rs` and `types.rs`
4. Main loop hooks in `main.rs`
5. UI in `ui.rs`
6. Docs updates
