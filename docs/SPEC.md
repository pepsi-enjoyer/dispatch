# Dispatch

> Voice-powered command center for AI coding agents.

Turn your Android phone into a push-to-talk radio that dispatches tasks to AI coding agents. The PC-side TUI gives you a live quad-pane view of embedded agent terminals. Voice a big task and the orchestrator breaks it into subtasks, dispatches agents into isolated git worktrees, and merges results back -- all tracked in a simple markdown file (`.dispatch/tasks.md`).

## Overview

The system has two components:

1. **Dispatch Radio** (Android) -- a minimal push-to-talk app controlled via hardware volume buttons. Transcribes speech and sends raw transcripts over a local WebSocket connection to the console's orchestrator.
2. **Dispatch Console** (PC) -- a TUI command center with up to 26 embedded terminal panes (displayed 4 at a time in a 2x2 grid across pages), each running a live AI agent session. A persistent LLM orchestrator receives voice transcripts and decides what to do -- dispatch agents, decompose complex tasks, merge completed work, etc. Supports direct keyboard input into any agent pane via a vim-style modal interface.

Both components live in a single monorepo.

The `.dispatch/` directory is gitignored by the console on first run.

## Agent Naming

Every agent is assigned a callsign from the NATO phonetic alphabet by default, in dispatch order:

| Slot | Callsign | Slot | Callsign  | Slot | Callsign  |
|------|----------|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| 1    | Alpha    | 10   | Juliet    | 19   | Sierra    |
| 2    | Bravo    | 11   | Kilo      | 20   | Tango     |
| 3    | Charlie  | 12   | Lima      | 21   | Uniform   |
| 4    | Delta    | 13   | Mike      | 22   | Victor    |
| 5    | Echo     | 14   | November  | 23   | Whiskey   |
| 6    | Foxtrot  | 15   | Oscar     | 24   | X-ray     |
| 7    | Golf     | 16   | Papa      | 25   | Yankee    |
| 8    | Hotel    | 17   | Quebec    | 26   | Zulu      |
| 9    | India    | 18   | Romeo     |      |           |

Maximum 26 concurrent agents. Callsigns are bound to slots, not agent instances. If Alpha is terminated and a new agent is dispatched into slot 1, it becomes Alpha again.

Agents can be renamed from the console via the `R` key. Custom names replace the NATO default until the agent is terminated, at which point the slot reverts.

Callsigns are the primary identifier for voice commands. All agents are addressable by voice regardless of which page is currently displayed in the console.

---

## Voice Commands

The radio sends raw voice transcripts to the console without any local parsing. The console's persistent LLM orchestrator (see `docs/ORCHESTRATOR.md`) receives these transcripts and decides what to do -- dispatch agents, send messages, terminate agents, merge tasks, etc.

### How It Works

1. User speaks into the radio (push-to-talk or continuous listening).
2. Radio transcribes speech via Android `SpeechRecognizer`.
3. Raw transcript is sent to the console as `{"type":"send","text":"...","auto":true}`.
4. Console forwards the transcript to the orchestrator as `[MIC] <transcript>`.
5. Orchestrator decides what action(s) to take and issues tool calls.
6. Console executes the tool calls and returns results to the orchestrator.

### Examples

| Utterance                                      | Orchestrator action                          |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| "Alpha, can you refactor the auth module"      | `message_agent` to Alpha                     |
| "dispatch an agent to fix the login bug"       | `dispatch` with prompt                       |
| "terminate bravo"                              | `terminate` agent=Bravo                      |
| "what agents are running"                      | `list_agents`                                |
| "refactor the auth system"                     | Decompose and `dispatch` multiple agents     |
| "merge alpha's work"                           | `merge` task                                 |

The orchestrator understands natural language -- there are no fixed command patterns. It uses the full context of the conversation (agent states, prior tool results, etc.) to decide the best action.

---

## Task Management

Tasks are tracked in `.dispatch/tasks.md` at the repo root. The orchestrator handles all task lifecycle: decomposition, dispatch, and completion. Each agent works in an isolated git worktree. No external tooling required.

### Task Format

```markdown
# Refactor auth system

- [ ] t1: Extract auth middleware into separate module
  - [ ] t1.1: Create auth module skeleton
  - [ ] t1.2: Move JWT validation logic -> t1.1
  - [ ] t1.3: Update imports across codebase -> t1.1, t1.2
- [ ] t2: Add OAuth2 support -> t1
- [ ] t3: Write integration tests -> t2
```

**Status markers:** `[ ]` open, `[~]` in progress (with agent annotation), `[x]` done.

**Dependencies:** `-> t1.1, t1.2` means "blocked by t1.1 and t1.2". No arrow means no blockers. Indentation is for readability; the `->` arrow is what encodes dependencies.

**Agent annotation:** when a task is assigned, the console appends `| agent: Callsign`:

```
- [~] t1.1: Create auth module skeleton | agent: Alpha
```

### Task Decomposition

When a voice prompt describes a complex task (e.g. "refactor the auth system"), the orchestrator decomposes it directly:

1. **Analysis**: the orchestrator identifies the distinct pieces of work and their dependencies.
2. **Plan output**: the orchestrator writes the task breakdown to `.dispatch/tasks.md` with IDs, descriptions, and dependency arrows.
3. **Dispatch begins**: the orchestrator calls `dispatch` for each independent (unblocked) task, running them in parallel.
4. **Sequencing**: as `TASK_COMPLETE` events arrive, the orchestrator dispatches dependent tasks that are now unblocked.
For simple one-off prompts (e.g. "Alpha, fix this typo"), the orchestrator calls `dispatch` directly without decomposition. See [ORCHESTRATOR.md](ORCHESTRATOR.md) for the full decision-making logic.

### Git Worktrees

Each task runs in an isolated git worktree to prevent agents from stepping on each other.

**On task assignment:**

```
git worktree add .dispatch/.worktrees/{task_id} -b task/{task_id}
```

The agent's PTY is launched with its working directory set to the worktree path. The agent sees a normal git repo and works as usual.

**On task completion:**

1. The console merges the task branch back to the main branch.
2. If the merge succeeds, the worktree is cleaned up: `git worktree remove .dispatch/.worktrees/{task_id}`.
3. If the merge has conflicts, the console flags it on the ticker and leaves the worktree intact for manual review.

**On agent termination:**

If an agent is terminated before completing its task, the worktree and branch are preserved. The task is marked `[ ]` (open) so it can be picked up later -- the next agent assigned to it reuses the existing worktree.

The `.dispatch/` directory is gitignored.

### Multi-Repo Mode

Dispatch supports two workspace modes:

**Single-repo mode** (default): Launched inside a git repo. Behaves as documented above -- one repo, `.dispatch/` in the repo root.

**Multi-repo mode**: Launched from a directory that is not itself a git repo. Dispatch scans immediate children for directories containing `.git` and holds the list in memory. No `.dispatch/` or workspace-level artifacts are created at the parent directory level.

In multi-repo mode:

- Pressing `n` opens a repo selector overlay instead of dispatching immediately. The user picks which repo to target.
- Each agent slot tracks its own `repo_root`. Task and worktree operations use the slot's repo, not a global root.
- The task list overlay (`t`) aggregates tasks from all detected repos.
- Pressing `S` rescans child directories for new or removed repos.
- The header bar shows the repo count.
- Auto-startup (dispatching Alpha on launch) is skipped; the user must select a repo first.

### Task Lifecycle

**Complex task (decomposition flow):**

```
Voice: "refactor the auth system"
  -> Orchestrator analyzes task, writes breakdown to .dispatch/tasks.md
  -> Ticker: "Decomposing: refactor the auth system..."
  -> Dispatches agents into worktrees for unblocked tasks
  -> On completion: merge, mark [x], check what's unblocked
  -> Dispatches next ready tasks
  -> Repeat until all tasks are done
```

**Simple prompt (direct flow):**

```
Voice: "Alpha, fix the login bug"
  -> Console creates single task in .dispatch/tasks.md
  -> Creates worktree, assigns to Alpha
  -> Alpha works in worktree
  -> On completion: merge, mark [x], clean up
```

**Prompt delivery:** the prompt text is sent to the agent's terminal, prefixed with a context line:

```
[task t1.2] Move JWT validation logic to the new auth module
```

### Auto-Dispatch

When a prompt arrives without a specified agent:

1. The orchestrator creates a task (or decomposes it into subtasks if the task is complex).
2. It checks agent states:
   - If an idle agent exists, assign the task to it.
   - If all agents are busy and an empty slot exists, dispatch a new agent (default tool: `claude-code`) and assign the task.
   - If all slots are full and all agents are busy, add the task as `[ ]` (open/queued) and notify the radio: "All agents busy, task queued."
3. Queued tasks are picked up automatically when an agent becomes idle. The console scans `.dispatch/tasks.md` for `[ ]` tasks with no unresolved `->` dependencies.

### Orchestrator Tool Interface

The console exposes a set of actions that the orchestrator LLM can invoke to manage the dispatch system. The orchestrator emits action blocks (JSON wrapped in ` ```action ` fenced code blocks), which the console parses and executes.

**Action block format:**

````
```action
{"action": "dispatch", "repo": "myrepo", "prompt": "fix the auth bug"}
```
````

The console parses the `"action"` field to determine which tool to execute. Parameters vary by action type (see table below).

**Available actions:**

| Action | Parameters | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `dispatch` | `repo`, `prompt` | Create a task, set up a git worktree, and dispatch an agent. Returns slot, callsign, and task ID. |
| `terminate` | `agent` | Kill an agent by callsign or slot number. Frees the slot and reopens the task for reassignment. |
| `merge` | `task_id` | Merge a task's worktree branch into main. Returns success/failure with conflict details. |
| `list_agents` | _(none)_ | List all active agent slots with callsign, tool, busy/idle status, current task, and repo. |
| `list_repos` | _(none)_ | List available repositories that agents can work in. |
| `message_agent` | `agent`, `text` | Send text to an agent's terminal (PTY). Use for follow-up instructions or answering agent questions. |

The `agent` parameter accepts either a callsign (e.g. "Alpha") or a slot number (e.g. "1"), case-insensitive.

### Task Completion Detection

Determining when an agent has finished a task is non-trivial. The console uses a two-layer strategy, evaluated in priority order:

**Layer 1 -- Idle prompt detection (primary)**

The console watches the virtual terminal screen (via the `vt100` parser) for idle prompt patterns that indicate the agent has returned to a ready state:

| Tool        | Idle pattern                |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| claude-code | `^> $` on last active row  |
| gh copilot  | `What would you like help with?` or the prompt cursor `?` |
| Shell       | Prompt ending in `$ ` or `# ` |

The pattern match applies to the last non-blank row of the virtual screen. A match is confirmed only after no new output has arrived for 500ms, to avoid false positives during streaming output that briefly hits the idle-looking state.

**Layer 2 -- Inactivity timeout (safety net)**

If layer 1 does not fire within a configurable timeout after the last PTY output, the console marks the task complete. Default timeout: 60 seconds. Configurable in `config.toml`:

```toml
[tasks]
completion_timeout_secs = 60  # 0 to disable
```

When this fires, the agent is marked idle and can receive new tasks. The pane briefly shows a "timed out" indicator.

**State machine**

Each agent slot tracks a `completion_state`:

```
Idle -> Busy (task assigned + prompt delivered)
Busy -> Idle (layer 1 or 2 triggered -> merge worktree -> mark [x])
```

Only one completion event fires per task: whichever layer triggers first cancels the other.

### Ticker

A single-line LED-style scrolling marquee between the header bar and the quad panes. Text scrolls right-to-left continuously. Messages queue up -- when one finishes scrolling off, the next starts. When idle, the line is blank.

**Message sources:**

- Decomposition status: `Decomposing: breaking down "refactor auth" into 5 subtasks...`
- Task events: `t1.1 complete, merging... t1.2 unblocked, dispatching to Bravo`
- Merge results: `t1.1 merged to main` or `t1.3 merge conflict, needs manual review`
- Errors: `All agents busy, task t4 queued`

**Rendering:** fixed-width viewport, text offset decremented each frame tick (e.g. every 50ms). Once a message scrolls fully off-screen, it is discarded and the next queued message begins. If multiple messages queue up during a burst (e.g. several tasks completing at once), they scroll sequentially with a small gap between them.

### Task Visibility

The console displays task state across multiple areas:

- **Header bar**: total task progress (e.g. `Tasks: 3/7`) and queued count.
- **Ticker**: real-time event stream (planning, dispatch, merges, errors).
- **Pane info strip**: each pane shows its current task ID or "idle".
- **Task list overlay** (`t` key): full view of all tasks with status, agent assignments, and dependencies.
- **Orchestrator view** (`o` key): toggles the main area between the 2x2 agent grid and a scrollable orchestrator event log showing voice transcripts, reasoning decisions, and tool calls in real time.

### Orchestrator View

Pressing `o` in command mode replaces the 2x2 agent grid with a full-height scrollable log of orchestrator events. Each entry is timestamped and categorized:

- **MIC**: incoming voice transcripts from the radio.
- **DECOMPOSE**: task decomposition start, completion (with task count), or failure.
- **TASK**: task creation in `.dispatch/tasks.md`.
- **ASSIGN**: task assigned to an agent slot.
- **DONE**: task completed (idle prompt detected or inactivity timeout).
- **MERGE**: worktree merged to main.
- **CONFLICT**: merge conflict detected.
- **DISPATCH**: agent launched into a slot.
- **TERM**: agent terminated.
- **QUEUE**: task queued (all agents busy).

Pressing `o` again returns to the agent grid. While in the orchestrator view, `Up`/`Down` and `PageUp`/`PageDown` scroll through history. The footer shows contextual hints for the active view mode.

### Prompt History and Logging

All voice prompts from the radio and keyboard input submitted in input mode are recorded with timestamps to `.dispatch/prompt_history.log`. The log is append-only, human-readable, and persists across sessions.

**Log format:**

```
[14:32:05] VOICE -> ALPHA: "refactor the auth module"
[14:35:12] KEYBOARD -> ALPHA: "fix the typo in line 42"
[14:38:00] VOICE -> orchestrator: "set up CI pipeline for all microservices"
[14:40:15] VOICE -> queued: "add rate limiting to the API"
```

**Keyboard input tracking:** in input mode, the console maintains a shadow buffer of typed characters. When Enter is pressed, the accumulated text is saved to the history log. The shadow buffer is cleared on mode exit (Escape).

**History overlay:** pressing `h` in command mode opens a scrollable prompt history overlay. Each entry shows timestamp, source (MIC for voice, KBD for keyboard), target agent, and prompt text. Navigation: `j`/`k` or `Up`/`Down` to scroll, `g`/`G` for top/bottom, `Enter` to re-send the selected prompt to the current target, `Esc` to close.

---

## Protocol

Communication happens over a single WebSocket connection. Messages are JSON. Either side can initiate messages.

### mDNS / Zeroconf Discovery

The console advertises itself on the local network via mDNS (DNS-SD) as a `_dispatch._tcp.local.` service. The service name is the console's hostname. The radio discovers this service using Android's `NsdManager` API, eliminating the need for manual IP entry.

- **Console**: uses the `mdns-sd` crate to register the service on startup. The service is advertised on all network interfaces with automatic address detection.
- **Radio**: the Settings screen has a "DISCOVER CONSOLE" button that scans for `_dispatch._tcp.` services for up to 5 seconds. When found, the host and port fields are auto-filled.

Manual IP/port entry remains available as a fallback.

### TLS

The WebSocket server uses TLS (`wss://`) for encrypted transport. On first run, the console generates a self-signed certificate and private key, stored as DER files in the config directory (`~/.config/dispatch/cert.der` and `key.der`). The certificate covers the SANs `dispatch.local` and `localhost`.

The radio pins the certificate by its SHA-256 fingerprint (provided via QR code pairing) rather than relying on a CA chain. When no fingerprint is available (manual connection), the radio trusts any certificate -- the PSK still authenticates the connection, and TLS provides encryption.

### Authentication

The WebSocket handshake includes a pre-shared key as a query parameter:

```
wss://192.168.1.x:9800/?psk=<key>
```

The console generates a random PSK on first run and stores it in `~/.config/dispatch/config.toml`. The key is displayed on the console's header bar (truncated, expandable with `p`). Any connection attempt with an invalid or missing PSK is rejected with a 401 before the WebSocket upgrade completes.

**QR code pairing:** Press `Q` in command mode to display a QR code overlay encoding the full WebSocket URL (`wss://host:port/?psk=key&fp=<sha256>`). The host is auto-detected from the machine's local network interface. The `fp` parameter is the SHA-256 fingerprint of the console's TLS certificate. The radio scans this QR code via its camera (Settings > Scan QR) to configure the connection without manual entry. The scanned URL populates host, port, PSK, and cert fingerprint fields automatically.

### Message Types

**List agents**

```
-> { "type": "list_agents" }
<- {
     "type": "agents",
     "slots": [
       { "slot": 1, "callsign": "Alpha", "tool": "claude-code", "status": "busy", "task": "t-1" },
       { "slot": 2, "callsign": "Bravo", "tool": "claude-code", "status": "idle", "task": null },
       { "slot": 3, "callsign": "Charlie", "tool": "copilot", "status": "idle", "task": null },
       { "slot": 4, "callsign": null, "tool": null, "status": "empty", "task": null }
     ],
     "target": 1,
     "queued_tasks": 0
   }
```

Slots are numbered 1-26. Only active (dispatched) and empty slots on allocated pages are included. `task` is the current task ID if the agent is working on one.

**Set target**

```
-> { "type": "set_target", "slot": 2 }
<- { "type": "target_changed", "slot": 2, "callsign": "Bravo" }
```

**Send prompt**

```
-> { "type": "send", "text": "refactor the auth module to use JWT" }
<- { "type": "ack", "slot": 1, "callsign": "Alpha", "task": "t-1" }
```

Sent to the current target. The console creates a task, assigns it, and returns the task ID in the ack.

**Send prompt to specific agent**

```
-> { "type": "send", "text": "write unit tests", "slot": 3 }
<- { "type": "ack", "slot": 3, "callsign": "Charlie", "task": "t-2" }
```

**Send prompt with auto-dispatch**

```
-> { "type": "send", "text": "set up the CI pipeline", "auto": true }
<- { "type": "ack", "slot": 2, "callsign": "Bravo", "task": "t-3", "auto_dispatched": false }
```

`auto: true` tells the console to pick the best agent. Response includes whether a new agent was auto-dispatched.

**Dispatch new agent**

```
-> { "type": "dispatch", "tool": "claude-code", "slot": 3 }
<- { "type": "dispatched", "slot": 3, "callsign": "Charlie", "tool": "claude-code" }
```

**Terminate agent**

```
-> { "type": "terminate", "slot": 2 }
<- { "type": "terminated", "slot": 2, "callsign": "Bravo" }
```

**Rename agent**

```
-> { "type": "rename", "slot": 2, "callsign": "Jenkins" }
<- { "type": "renamed", "slot": 2, "callsign": "Jenkins" }
```

**Radio status**

```
-> { "type": "radio_status", "state": "listening" }
-> { "type": "radio_status", "state": "idle" }
```

**Chat (server push)**

```
<- { "type": "chat", "sender": "Dispatcher", "text": "Dispatched agent Alpha." }
<- { "type": "chat", "sender": "Alpha", "text": "Task t1 complete." }
<- { "type": "chat", "sender": "You", "text": "refactor the auth module" }
```

Pushed to all connected clients whenever the orchestrator produces text, agents complete tasks, or other significant events occur. Not a response to any request -- the console pushes these proactively. The `sender` field identifies who said it: `"You"` for voice transcripts, `"Dispatcher"` for orchestrator decisions, or an agent callsign (e.g. `"Alpha"`) for agent events.

**Error**

```
<- { "type": "error", "message": "all slots full and busy, task queued as t-7" }
```

### Design Notes

- All messages are JSON in WebSocket text frames.
- Unknown message types are silently ignored for forward compatibility.
- Messages include an optional `seq` field for request-response correlation.
- The radio re-requests `list_agents` on reconnect to sync state.
- The `chat` message type is a server push -- it is sent without a corresponding request. The WebSocket server uses a broadcast channel to push chat messages to all connected clients simultaneously.

## Dispatch Console (PC TUI)

### Target

- Rust
- Dependencies: `ratatui`, `crossterm`, `tokio`, `tokio-tungstenite`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `toml`, `portable-pty`, `vt100`, `dirs`, `notify` (file watcher), `mdns-sd` (mDNS advertisement), `hostname`
- Single binary, cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Embedded Terminals

Each agent pane is a real terminal emulator, not a text capture. The console manages PTYs directly -- there is no tmux dependency.

**Platform support:**

- **Linux/macOS**: uses native Unix PTYs (via `openpty`).
- **Windows**: uses ConPTY (Console Pseudo Terminal), available on Windows 10 1809+. ConPTY is what Windows Terminal uses internally. The `portable-pty` crate (by the WezTerm author) abstracts over both backends behind a single API, so application code is platform-agnostic.

The rest of the stack is also cross-platform: `crossterm` for terminal input/output, `ratatui` for rendering, `vt100` for escape sequence parsing (it operates on byte streams, so it's OS-independent). Claude Code and `gh copilot` both support Windows natively.

**Architecture per slot:**

1. **PTY**: created via `portable-pty`. A child process (e.g. `claude`) runs inside the PTY.
2. **VTE parser**: the `vt100` crate maintains a virtual terminal grid by processing the PTY's output stream. This correctly handles escape sequences, colors, cursor movement, scrollback, and alternate screen buffers.
3. **Renderer**: `ratatui` reads the `vt100::Screen` grid and renders it into the pane widget, mapping terminal colors to ratatui styles.
4. **Input**: in input mode, keystrokes are written directly to the PTY file descriptor. This is instantaneous -- no subprocess spawning, no tmux.

This makes each pane a fully interactive terminal. You see exactly what you'd see in a normal terminal emulator, including color output, progress bars, and TUI applications like Claude Code's interface.

### Visual Design

911 dispatch / command center aesthetic. High information density, dark background, status-driven color.

**Color language:**

| Color          | Meaning                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Green          | Connected, active, healthy     |
| Amber/Yellow   | Busy, processing, in-progress  |
| Red            | Disconnected, error, alert     |
| Cyan           | Targeted (receiving next radio prompt) |
| White on dark  | Default text                   |
| Dim grey       | Secondary info, IDs, timestamps|

### Layout

The console displays four agent panes at a time in a 2x2 grid. With more than four agents, panes are spread across multiple pages. All agents remain active regardless of which page is visible -- off-screen agents keep running and are still addressable by voice.

**Page structure:**

- Page 1: slots 1-4 (Alpha through Delta)
- Page 2: slots 5-8 (Echo through Hotel)
- Page 3: slots 9-12 (India through Lima)
- ...up to page 7 (26 slots max)

Pages are cycled with `Left` / `Right` arrow keys. The header shows the current page and total pages.

```

**Auto-navigate:** when you address an agent by voice or select a slot number that's on a different page, the console automatically switches to that page. Targeting Alpha while viewing page 2 flips back to page 1.

**Input mode** changes the footer and the targeted pane's border:

```

Bright green border on the active pane. Footer shows mode indicator.

**Regions:**

1. **Header bar** -- radio connection state, PSK (truncated), task progress (done/total), current page indicator, clock.
2. **Ticker** -- single-line LED-style scrolling marquee. Shows decomposition status, task events, merge results, and errors. Text scrolls right-to-left. Blank when idle. See [Ticker](#ticker).
3. **Quad pane** -- four slots from the current page. Targeted pane has `▸` marker and cyan border (command mode) or green border (input mode). Each pane has:
   - **Info strip**: callsign, tool type, current task ID (or "idle"), dispatch time, and runtime.
   - **Terminal area**: live embedded terminal output rendered from the VTE parser.
   - Empty slots show "STANDBY" with dispatch shortcuts. The last STANDBY slot on the last page also shows queued task count and titles.
4. **Footer bar** -- command mode: radio state, target (regardless of page), page navigation, shortcuts. Input mode: `-- INPUT ({CALLSIGN}) --` with ESC hint.

### Input Model

Modal, vim-style. Two modes:

**Command mode** (default) -- keystrokes control the console.

**Input mode** -- keystrokes are written directly to the targeted agent's PTY. The terminal in the pane is fully interactive: you can type prompts, use arrow keys, tab completion, Ctrl+C to cancel, scroll through output -- everything. Because writes go straight to the PTY file descriptor, there is zero latency overhead.

| Transition       | Key         | Behavior                                           |
|------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Command -> Input | `Enter`     | Enter input mode on the currently targeted pane    |
| Input -> Command | `Escape`    | Return to command mode                             |

While in input mode, `Escape` is the only key intercepted by the console. Everything else goes to the PTY. If the underlying tool uses `Escape`, press it twice.

**Radio commands during input mode:** voice commands from the radio are always processed regardless of console mode. The two input channels (keyboard and radio) operate independently.

#### Command Mode Keys

| Key               | Action                                                       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Enter`           | Enter input mode on targeted pane                            |
| `1-4`             | Select target slot on current page (slot = page offset + key)|
| `Tab`             | Cycle target forward across all pages (skips empty slots, auto-navigates) |
| `Shift+Tab`       | Cycle target backward across all pages                       |
| `Right`             | Next page                                                  |
| `Left`              | Previous page                                              |
| `n`               | Dispatch new agent (repo selector in multi-repo mode)        |
| `N`               | Dispatch new agent into a specific slot (prompts for slot number) |
| `x`               | Terminate agent in currently targeted slot (confirms first)  |
| `R`               | Rename agent in currently targeted slot                      |
| `S`               | Rescan repos (multi-repo mode only)                          |
| `t`               | Show task list overlay (plan, active, queued, completed)             |
| `h`               | Show prompt history overlay (browse and re-send past prompts) |
| `o`               | Toggle orchestrator view (replaces agent grid with event log) |
| `p`               | Show/hide full PSK                                           |
| `Q`               | Show QR code overlay for radio pairing                       |
| `q`               | Quit (confirms if agents are running)                        |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn`   | Scroll pane output up/down (half-page increments)            |
| `?`               | Toggle help overlay                                          |

`Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycle through all active agents across all pages, not just the current page. The view auto-navigates to the page containing the newly targeted agent. `1-4` always refer to the four slots on the current page -- so pressing `2` on page 2 selects slot 6 (Foxtrot).

### PTY Management

The console manages process lifecycles directly. No tmux.

**Agent dispatch:**

```rust
// Pseudocode
let pty = portable_pty::native_pty_system().open_pty(PtySize { rows: 24, cols: 80 })?;
let child = pty.slave.spawn_command(CommandBuilder::new("claude"))?;
let reader = pty.master.try_clone_reader()?;
let writer = pty.master.take_writer()?;
let vte = vt100::Parser::new(24, 80, 1000); // rows, cols, scrollback
```

**Output processing:**

A tokio task per slot reads from the PTY reader and feeds bytes into the `vt100::Parser`. The parser maintains a `Screen` object representing the current terminal state. The ratatui render loop reads from this screen on each frame.

**Scrollback:** the `vt100::Parser` is initialized with a scrollback buffer (default 1000 lines, configurable via `terminal.scrollback_lines`). In command mode, `PgUp`/`PgDn` scroll the targeted pane by half-page increments. A `SCROLL` indicator appears when not at the bottom. Scrollback resets to the bottom on new output or when entering input mode.

**Input forwarding (input mode):**

Keystrokes from crossterm are translated to ANSI sequences and written to the PTY writer. Regular characters are written as-is. Special keys are mapped:

| Key              | ANSI sequence    |
|------------------|------------------|
| Enter            | `\r`             |
| Backspace        | `\x7f`          |
| Tab              | `\t`             |
| Up               | `\x1b[A`        |
| Down             | `\x1b[B`        |
| Right            | `\x1b[C`        |
| Left             | `\x1b[D`        |
| Home             | `\x1b[H`        |
| End              | `\x1b[F`        |
| Ctrl+C           | `\x03`          |
| Ctrl+D           | `\x04`          |
| Ctrl+L           | `\x0c`          |

These ANSI sequences are universal -- they're written to the PTY, not the host terminal, so they work identically on Windows (ConPTY), macOS, and Linux. The host terminal differences are handled by `crossterm` on the input side.

**Prompt injection (from voice or auto-dispatch):**

When a prompt arrives from the radio (or from task auto-dispatch), it is written to the PTY as if typed, followed by `\r` (Enter). This happens regardless of the console's current input mode.

```rust
writer.write_all(format!("{}\r", prompt_text).as_bytes())?;
```

**Terminal resize:**

When the console window is resized, each PTY is notified via `pty.master.resize()` and the VTE parser dimensions are updated. The terminal content reflows.

Resize events are debounced with a **100ms delay**. When a resize event arrives, any pending resize is cancelled and a fresh 100ms timer starts. Only after 100ms of no further resize events are the PTYs and `vt100::Parser` dimensions actually updated. This prevents rendering artifacts from resize storms during window drag on all platforms (including Windows ConPTY, which has higher per-resize overhead).

```rust
// Pseudocode: debounced resize in the event loop
let mut resize_deadline: Option<tokio::time::Instant> = None;

// On crossterm resize event:
resize_deadline = Some(tokio::time::Instant::now() + Duration::from_millis(100));

// In the tick/select loop, after 100ms elapses:
if let Some(deadline) = resize_deadline {
    if tokio::time::Instant::now() >= deadline {
        resize_deadline = None;
        let (cols, rows) = crossterm::terminal::size()?;
        for slot in active_slots.iter_mut() {
            slot.pty_master.resize(PtySize { rows, cols, pixel_width: 0, pixel_height: 0 })?;
            slot.vte_parser.set_size(rows, cols);
        }
    }
}
```

**Agent termination:**

The child process is killed, the PTY is closed, and the slot is marked empty. Any active task for that agent is updated to `[ ]` (open/unassigned) in `.dispatch/tasks.md` so it can be picked up later. The worktree and branch are preserved for the next agent.

### Configuration

Stored in a platform-appropriate config directory, auto-generated on first run:

- **Linux**: `~/.config/dispatch/config.toml`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/dispatch/config.toml`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\dispatch\config.toml`

The `dirs` crate handles path resolution.

```toml
[server]
port = 9800
bind = "0.0.0.0"

[auth]
# Auto-generated. Run `dispatch regenerate-psk` to rotate.
psk = "a7f3e9b1c4d8..."

[terminal]
scrollback_lines = 1000
# Maximum concurrent agents. 4-26, in multiples of 4 (one page per 4 agents).
max_agents = 8

[tasks]
# Base directory for dispatch artifacts in the target repo (tasks.md, .worktrees/).
dir = ".dispatch"
# Auto-dispatch agents for unaddressed prompts.
auto_dispatch = true
# Default tool for auto-dispatched agents.
default_tool = "claude-code"
# Inactivity timeout for task completion detection (seconds). 0 to disable.
completion_timeout_secs = 60
# Auto-merge completed task branches to main. If false, branches are left for manual review.
auto_merge = true

[tools]
claude-code = "claude"
copilot = "gh copilot suggest"
```

### CLI

```
dispatch                    # Start the console (default)
dispatch regenerate-psk     # Generate a new PSK
dispatch show-psk           # Print the current PSK to stdout
dispatch config             # Print config file path
```

### Settings

- **Console discovery**: mDNS scan to auto-fill address and port.
- **Console address**: IP and port (auto-filled by discovery or manual entry).
- **Pre-shared key**: manual entry or QR scan.
- **Haptic feedback**: toggle (default on).
- **Confirm before send**: toggle (default off).
- **Keep screen on**: toggle (default on).
- **Language**: speech recognition locale (default `en-AU`).
- **Continuous listening**: toggle (default off). When enabled, Volume Down toggles continuous listening on/off instead of push-to-talk. Uses SpeechRecognizer's built-in silence detection as VAD.
- **Background volume keys**: opens Android Accessibility Settings to enable `VolumeKeyAccessibilityService`. Shows ENABLED/DISABLED status.

### Speech Recognition

- Android `SpeechRecognizer` API.
- `EXTRA_PARTIAL_RESULTS` enabled.
- `EXTRA_LANGUAGE` set to configured locale.
- Offline recognition preferred, cloud fallback.
- No timeout while volume down is held (PTT mode).

### Continuous Listening Mode

When the "Continuous Listening (VAD)" setting is enabled:

- **Volume Down** acts as a toggle: tap to start continuous listening, tap again to stop.
- SpeechRecognizer's silence detection acts as voice-activity detection (VAD):
  - `EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_COMPLETE_SILENCE_LENGTH_MILLIS`: 1500 ms
  - `EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_POSSIBLY_COMPLETE_SILENCE_LENGTH_MILLIS`: 1000 ms
  - `EXTRA_SPEECH_INPUT_MINIMUM_LENGTH_MILLIS`: 500 ms
- After each utterance is processed, recognition auto-restarts after a 300 ms delay.
- The listening panel shows "CONTINUOUS" instead of "LISTENING" to indicate the mode.
- `onRmsChanged` drives the `AudioLevelView` bar with real audio levels.
- No-speech timeouts and errors trigger automatic restart rather than stopping.

### Background Volume Key Capture (AccessibilityService)

When the activity is in the foreground, volume key events are handled by `MainActivity.onKeyDown` / `onKeyUp` as normal. When the activity is backgrounded or the screen is off, an Android `AccessibilityService` intercepts volume key events and forwards them through a static `VolumeKeyBridge` singleton so PTT and target cycling continue to work hands-free.

**Architecture:**

- `VolumeKeyAccessibilityService` extends `AccessibilityService` with `flagRequestFilterKeyEvents`.
- `VolumeKeyBridge` singleton holds a foreground flag and a key event callback registered by `MainActivity`.
- `MainActivity` sets `isActivityInForeground = true` in `onResume`, `false` in `onPause`.
- When the service receives a volume key event and the activity is NOT in the foreground, it invokes the bridge callback, which calls the activity's existing `onKeyDown` / `onKeyUp`.
- When the activity IS in the foreground, the service returns `false` to let normal dispatch handle it.
- Volume Up long press (Quick Dispatch overlay) is suppressed when backgrounded since a dialog cannot be shown without a foreground activity. Short press (target cycling) works in both states.

**Setup:** The user must enable the service in Android Settings > Accessibility. The settings screen provides a shortcut button and shows the current status (ENABLED / DISABLED).

### Code Vocabulary Accuracy

Programming terms ("JWT", "OAuth", "useState", etc.) often transcribe incorrectly with general speech models. Two mechanisms are used together:

**1. `EXTRA_BIASING_STRINGS`** -- passed in the `RecognizerIntent` to hint the recognizer toward known terms. Engine support varies; Google's recognizer honors it, third-party engines may not. Include the canonical forms of common terms (e.g. "JWT", "OAuth", "useState", "TypeScript").

**2. Post-processing correction table** -- applied to every transcript after recognition, before sending to the console. Engine-independent and fully testable. Maps phonetic variants to canonical forms:

| Raw transcript                        | Corrected      |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| jay double you tea / jwt              | JWT            |
| o auth / oh auth / oauth              | OAuth          |
| use state / usestate                  | useState       |
| use effect / useeffect                | useEffect      |
| type script / typescript              | TypeScript     |
| java script / javascript              | JavaScript     |
| git hub / github                      | GitHub         |
| react / react.js                      | React          |
| node.js / nodejs / node js            | Node.js        |
| postgres / postgress / post gres      | PostgreSQL     |

The correction pass runs after normalization (lowercase, trimmed) and before sending to the console. It uses whole-word replacement to avoid false positives.

Both mechanisms are additive: biasing reduces misrecognitions at the source; the correction table catches what biasing misses. Maintain both as new terms are encountered in use.

### Networking

- OkHttp WebSocket client.
- PSK in connection URL query parameter.
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s).
- Ping/pong keepalive every 15s.
- On connect/reconnect: request `list_agents` to sync state.
